                            <p>Last September, the GenAI Summit 2023 in Silicon Valley welcomed 2,000 attendees, setting a remarkable precedent. This year, we're scaling new heights with the GenAI Summit 2024 in San Francisco. Hosted within the historic walls of the Palace of Fine Arts, the summit represents a portal to the dynamic world of generative AI. Over the course of three immersive days, we anticipate a gathering of at least 50,000 attendees during the event week. This event is more than a mere conferenceâ€”it's a crucible of innovation, destined to shape the future of technology and cultivate the industry's next leaders.</p>
                            {/* <p>We are at the dawn of a new technological wave, with generative AI revealing a future of infinite possibilities. With over 1500 attendees, 50+ startups, and more than 500 developers, the summit brings together the world's most cutting-edge entrepreneurial teams and investment institutions to jointly explore the future of this field.</p> */}
